# media-controls
A simple frontend for playerctl written in Java

## Installation
Installation is simple: clone the repo to your computer, then 
copy "media-control", "pause.png", and "play.png" into /usr/bin.
To do that, run this command from the root folder of the repo:

`cd app && sudo cp ./media-control /usr/bin && sudo cp pause.png /usr/bin && sudo cp play.png /usr/bin`

Then run it with `media-control`.

If you don't like to copy files to /usr/bin, just run it from any folder with `./media-control`. Just make sure the play.png and pause.png are in the same folder as the binary.
